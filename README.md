# ATS-controll-using-GSM
The SMS-controlled Automatic Transfer Switch system. the ATmega 328p microcontroller is used for controlling whole the process. Here we have used GSM wireless communication for controlling generators. We send some commands “Gen on”, “Gen off” and so on for controlling generators. After receiving given commands by Arduino through GSM, Arduino send a signal to relays, to switch ON or OFF the generator using a relay driver.
